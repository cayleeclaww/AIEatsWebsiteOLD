  <br/><h1><center>About Autoimmune Eats</center></h1>
  <p>
    Radical change is needed to improve the way we treat autoimmune disease. Autoimmune Eats is a resource to help
    guide this transformation. We support a revolution in care for the autoimmune community. </p>
    
    <p>People living with
    autoimmune disease face a wide set of physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual issues that are entirely
    unaddressed in the modern treatment of autoimmune disease. 
  </p>

  <p>
    We are here to make you feel seen. We are here to make you feel heard. We are here to build community to birth
    a better future for people just like you.

<h2>Our Approach to Autoimmune Disease</h2>
  <p>
  We want less suffering from autoimmune disease in the world. Period. Our goal is to help you find more answers
  so you can live with less pain. Both western science and ancient indigenous wisdoms are our guiding lights. We support
  the usage of both natural remedies and modern medications. 
  </p><br/>
   

   <h3>Our Approach to Food</h3>
   <p>We believe in healing the gut, supporting natural detoxification pathways, identifying food sensitivies safely,
    and medications when necessary. We do not endorse diets, fat shaming, food sensitivity testing, fear of food, 
    "detoxifying" outside of the body's natural pathways, or disordered eating. </p><br/>

    <h3>Our Approach to Neurodiversity</h3>
    <p>
      **Add statistic about % of AI dz and ND**. <br />
      Neurodiversity is a beautiful thing - we believe in supporting,
      uplifting, creating awareness for, plus reducing the pain and suffering of those who are neurodiverse and living 
      with autoimmune disease. We do not believe that neurodiversity is something that can or should be "cured".
    </p><br/>

    <h3>Our Approach to Environmentalism</h3>
    <p>
      Rates of autoimmune disease are on the rise. Why? We believe that increasing levels of toxic pollution in our air, 
      water, food, and general environment are major contributors. We seek to provide inexpensive, realistic, and 
      evidence-based solutions to help neurodiverse folks survive - and even thrive - in this reality.
